# DiningPhilosophersProblem
Implement several distributed mutual exclusion algorithms and use each to solve a specific synchronization problem. This project will use the centralized and token ring algorithms separately

Requirements:

1). 5 philosophers
2). Duration of eating and thinking phases is randomly selected at runtime (for each process)
3). Display messages that correspont to start and stop of each phase
4). Messages should not be delayed due to responsibilities (ex: even while eating/thinking, reply to message should not be delayed)
5). Completion of phase should not be delayed because I/O blocked
6). Deadlock free
7). More than one philosopher can eat at a time
8). Error checking and handling
9). Use Centralized Algorithm and the Token Ring Algorithm.
