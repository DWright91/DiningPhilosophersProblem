# DiningPhilosophersProblem
Implement several distributed mutual exclusion algorithms and use each to solve a specific synchronization problem. This project will use the centralized and token ring algorithms separately

Requirements:

5 philosophers

Duration of eating and thinking phases is randomly selected at runtime (for each process)

Display messages that correspont to start and stop of each phase

Messages should not be delayed due to responsibilities (ex: even while eating/thinking, reply to message should not be delayed)

Completion of phase should not be delayed because I/O blocked

Deadlock free

More than one philosopher can eat at a time

Error checking and handling


Use Centralized Algorithm and the Token Ring Algorithm.
